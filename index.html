    <h1>Cubic Spline Extrema</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the repository of the software algorithm that I invented/derived back in 1994 and then was published in Dr. Dobb's Journal in 1996.</p>
    <p>Clone the repository to get all the software goodies. The README has more details and is a good place to start.</p>
    <p>The algorithm essentially computes the minima and maxima (i.e. peaks and valleys) <ital>directly</ital> for a set of discrete data points.
      Typical searches require the use of bracketed iterative searches and are hence much less efficient. 
      My approach instead goes directly for a solution that computes a second derivative spline at the data "knots", and thus provides a fast and accurate set of results. The algorithm and implementation handles both "happy path" and "unhappy path" test cases, as exhibited by the test data sets used in the development of the algorithm. 
      Those data sets were presened in the original article, and are provided here for running verification tests.
      
      The algorithm was originally written in the C language and that is available here and now in the `c_lang` directory. 
      So the languages that I know at varying levels since that publication and will be making the algorithm available in next are Java, Python, C#, and possibly C++. 
      Therefore the 'ports' will involve redesign into object-oriented versions of the original implementation.
