    <h1>Cubic Spline Extrema</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the repository of the software algorithm that I invented/derived back in 1994 and then was published in Dr. Dobb's Journal in 1996.</p>
    <p>Clone the repository to get all the goodies. The README has more details and background and is a good place to start.</p>
    <p>
      <br>The algorithm essentially computes the minima and maxima (i.e. peaks and valleys) <strong>directly</strong> for a set of discrete data points.
      <br>Typical searches require the use of bracketed iterative searches and are hence much less efficient. 
      <br>My approach instead goes directly for a solution that computes a second derivative spline at the data "knots", and thus provides a fast and accurate set of results.
      <br>The algorithm and implementation handles both "happy path" and "unhappy path" test cases, as exhibited by the test data sets used in the development of the algorithm. 
      <br>Those data sets were presened in the original article, and are provided here for running verification tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>The algorithm was originally written in the C language and that is available here and now. 
      <br>The languages that I will be making the algorithm available in next are Java, Python, C#, and possibly C++. 
      <br>Therefore the 'ports' will involve redesign into object-oriented versions of the original implementation.
