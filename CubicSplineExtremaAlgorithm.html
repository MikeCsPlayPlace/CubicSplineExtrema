    <h1>Cubic Spline Extrema Algorithm</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The cubic spline extrema algorithm computes the relative extrema (i.e. maximums and minimums) of the continuous function that describes a discrete data set.
    <p>It uses all the given data to compute second derivatives  at each point, which are called knots in cubic spline parlance.
      Incidentally, the term 'spline' originates from drafting, in which pieces of wood were used to 'draw' smooth curves by bending them between knots. 
      Those pieces of wood were called splines. The shape assumbes by the spline between the knots is essentially a third degress (or cubic) polynomial.
      A disadvantage of tradition polynomial interpolators that attempt to solve complicated data-fitting is that they attempt to derive an
      single algorithm that satisfies all the data points. And furthermore, iterative searching across those curves is required to 
      hunt for the extrema.
      However, spline interpolation computes a different polynomial at each interval. 
      And my algorithm takes that a step further by forcing constraints at the knots while computing derivatives such that we yield equations
      that describe the existence and location of any extrema within each spline.
      This process directly yields the x values without the need for iterative searching. The y values are then computed based upon the associated spline equation.

    <h2>Derivation</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of cubic spline intepolation is to derive an interpolation formula in which the the first and second derivatives of the spline 
      polynomials are equals at the knots. This results in a formula with interval splines that intersect at the knots while exhibiting 
      a smooth transition from one interval to the next.
      Given a data set described by the general function y<sub>j</sub> = y(x<sub>j</sub>),
      the linear interpolation in the interval between x<sub>i</sub> and x<sub>i+1</sub> 
      can be expressed as equation 1:
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;y = Ay<sub>i</sub> + By<sub>i+1</sub> + Cy" + Dy"<sub>i+1</sub> </i></tt>
      <br>where <i>"</i> denotes the second derivative and the following apply:
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;A = (x<sub>i+1</sub> - x) / (x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;B = 1 - A </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;C = &frac16; [(A<sup>3</sup> - A)(x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>] </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;D = &frac16; [(B<sup>3</sup> - B)(x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>] </i></tt>
      <br>The first derivative of our equation for <i>y</i> is denoted as <i>dy/dx</i> and is solved as equation 2:
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;dy/dx = (y<sub>i+1</sub> - y<sub>i</sub>) / (x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) - 
        &frac16; [(3A<sup>2</sup> - 1)(x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) * y"<sub>i</sub>] + 
        &frac16; [(3B<sup>2</sup> - 1)(x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) * y"<sub>i+1</sub>]
      </i></tt>
      <br>However, if you then take this further and set the above equation to 0, then a new equation can be derived
      that represents the extrema of our first equation. This then allows the identification of the points at which u remains 
      constant with repect to finite changes in x.
      <br>Expressing equation 2 in the quadratic form 
      <tt><i>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</i></tt>
      such that x can be solved, we get the components of the quadratic:
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;a = 3(y"<sub>i+1</sub> - y"<sub>i</sub>) </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;b = 6(x<sub>i+1</sub>y"<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>y"<sub>i+1</sub>) </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;c = 6y<sub>i+1</sub> - 6y<sub>i</sub>
        - (2x<sup>2</sup><sub>i+1</sub> - x<sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub> + 2x<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i+1</sub>) * y"<sub>i</sub> 
        - (x<sup>2</sup><sub>i+1</sub> - 2x<sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub> - 2x<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i+1</sub>) * y"<sub>i+1</sub>
      </i></tt>
      <br>and solving for that quadratic is essentially the foundation of cubic extrema equation.
      <br> Using these cubic-extrema quadratic coefficents and quadratic root solver yields the candidate extrema.
      If they lie within the current interval of examination then they are a valid abscissa value at which the 
      ordinate extrema exists. If not, then no extrema lies within that particular spline interval.
      <h2>Overall Code Flow</h2>
      The code steps for applying the algorithm are:
      <ol>Compute the second derivatives of each interval</ol>
      <ol>Calculate the cubic extrema quadratic coefficents and compute the roots of the quadratic equation</ol>
      <ol>Determine if the roots, which are candidate extremum abscissa, lie within the current interval</ol>
      <ol>Determine the corresponding ordinate value for each valid extremum abscissa</ol>
