    <h1>Cubic Spline Extrema Algorithm</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The cubic spline extrema algorithm computes the relative extrema (i.e. maximums and minimums) of the continuous function that describes a discrete data set.
    <p>It uses all the given data to compute second derivatives  at each point, which are called knots in cubic spline parlance.
      Incidentally, the term 'spline' originates from drafting, in which pieces of wood were used to 'draw' smooth curves by bending them between knots. 
      Those pieces of wood were called splines. The shape assumbes by the spline between the knots is essentially a third degress (or cubic) polynomial.
      A disadvantage of tradition polynomial interpolators that attempt to solve complicated data-fitting is that they attempt to derive an
      single algorithm that satisfies all the data points. And furthermore, iterative searching and interpolation within those curves is required to 
      hunt for the extrema.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, spline interpolation computes a different polynomial at each interval. 
      And my algorithm takes that a step further by forcing constraints at the knots while computing derivatives such that we yield equations
      that describe the existence and location of any extrema within each spline.
      This process directly yields the x values without the need for iterative searching. 
      The y values are then computed based upon the associated spline equation.
      The original derivation of the algorithm spans several handwritten pages that I still possess. Here are the final equations that came out of that work.
    </p>
    <h2>Derivation</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of cubic spline intepolation is to derive an interpolation formula in which the the first and second derivatives of the spline 
      polynomials are equals at the knots. This results in a formula with interval splines that intersect at the knots while exhibiting 
      a smooth transition from one interval to the next.
      Given a data set described by the general function y<sub>j</sub> = y(x<sub>j</sub>),
      the linear interpolation in the interval between x<sub>i</sub> and x<sub>i+1</sub> 
      can be expressed as equation 1:
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;y = Ay<sub>i</sub> + By<sub>i+1</sub> + Cy" + Dy"<sub>i+1</sub> </i></tt>
      <br>where <i>"</i> denotes the second derivative and the following apply:
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;A = (x<sub>i+1</sub> - x) / (x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;B = 1 - A </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;C = &frac16; [(A<sup>3</sup> - A)(x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>] </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;D = &frac16; [(B<sup>3</sup> - B)(x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>] </i></tt>
      <br>The first derivative of our equation for <i>y</i> is denoted as <i>dy/dx</i> and is solved as equation 2:
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;dy/dx = (y<sub>i+1</sub> - y<sub>i</sub>) / (x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) - 
        &frac16; [(3A<sup>2</sup> - 1)(x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) * y"<sub>i</sub>] + 
        &frac16; [(3B<sup>2</sup> - 1)(x<sub>i+1</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) * y"<sub>i+1</sub>]
      </i></tt>
      <br>However, if you then take this further and set the above equation to 0, then a new equation can be derived
      that represents the extrema of our first equation. This then allows the identification of the points at which <i>y</i> remains 
      constant with repect to finite changes in <i>x</i>.
      <br>Expressing equation 2 in the quadratic form 
      <tt><i>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</i></tt>
      such that x can be solved, we get the coefficients of the quadratic:
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;a = 3(y"<sub>i+1</sub> - y"<sub>i</sub>) </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;b = 6(x<sub>i+1</sub>y"<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>y"<sub>i+1</sub>) </i></tt>
      <br><tt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;c = 6y<sub>i+1</sub> - 6y<sub>i</sub>
        - (2x<sup>2</sup><sub>i+1</sub> - x<sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub> + 2x<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i+1</sub>) * y"<sub>i</sub> 
        - (x<sup>2</sup><sub>i+1</sub> - 2x<sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub> - 2x<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i+1</sub>) * y"<sub>i+1</sub>
      </i></tt>
      <br>and solving for that quadratic is essentially the foundation of cubic extrema equation.
      <br> Using these cubic-extrema quadratic coefficents and quadratic root solver yields the candidate extrema.
      If they lie within the current interval of examination then they are a valid abscissa value at which the 
      ordinate extrema exists. If not, then no extrema lies within that particular spline interval.
      <h2>Overall Code Flow</h2>
      The code steps for applying the algorithm are:
       <h4>Compute the Second Derivatives</h4>
      The derivative form of the cubic spline has everything required to perform the calculation of the quadratic
      coefficents except the second derivatives of the input data ordinates <tt>y"</tt>. 
      Those can be computed as the solution of a system of N spline equations in N unknowns. 
      The equations can be represented in symmetric triagonal form, and thus can be solved with a degenerate 
      version of Gaussian elimination. 

      <h4>Compute the Quadratic Roots</h4>
      Once we have the second derivatives at the knows, we can solve for the quadratic coefficients shown earlier.
      Because one or more coefficents may be very small, the results are computed using a quadratic solver that avoids
      accuracy errors. The software implementation includes checks for conditions that could result in distastrous
      operations, such as taking the square root of a negative number of dividing by zero.
      Either of these indicates early-on that an interval does not have an extrema.
      
      <h4>Perform Bounds Checking</h4>
      If at least one of the roots is a valid abscissa candidate, then bounds checking is performed to determine 
      if the root lies within the current interval. It is does, then its a valid root and also an abscissa location 
      at which an extremum lies.
      
      <h4>Calculate the Extremum-Ordinate</h4>
      If a valid abscissa has been found, then it's utilized to compute the corresponding ordinate value (aka the y value).
      Since the second derivative has already been computed, this calculation is easy using the standard equation for 
      a cubic spline.
