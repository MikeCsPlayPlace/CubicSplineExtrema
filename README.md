# CubicSplineExtrema

This is the main level for access to the software algorithm that I invented/derived back in 1994 and was published in Dr. Dobb's Journal back in April 1996. That was the premier software engineering magazine back in those days and I was a subscriber. Thus I was honored that my algorithm, explanation, and implemenation were chosen to be printed within it's covers. And they actually paid me for my work ... well a small sum anyway.

For some background, I actually came up with the algorithm when my then-boss came to me with a problem. He had some satellite images that he was computing cross-correlations of to figure out the proper stereoscopic perspectives. He asked if I knew of a way to figure out the best correlation point (the peak value) quicker instead of the iterative shifting and computing that he was performing. I did not, but told him I would research it. I was not able to find any way in the literature (image processing magazines and books) or "online" (which was in it's early days back then). Therefore I thought about the problem and it seemed to me that given a set of cross correlation "similarity" values I should be able to take a good guess at what the peak value should be. And I surmised that this came down to a data best fit problem in which I wanted to exactly force an unknown polynomial function to go through those measured values. That felt like something that a set of cubic splines could solve. Furthermore, if I were to compute the first and second derivatives of the spline polynomials such that they are equal at each 'knot' (i.e. input value) then the result would be a formula whose splines exhibit a smooth transition between knots but travel precisely through them. So I went to work on deriving the equations in my free time, conjurred up some test data based on known equations, and many hours and pages later I had something that worked on paper!

By then my boss had already found a robotics vision algorithm that solved his exact needs, so my work sat aside for a couple years until I decided to generalize the algorithm a bit more and then coded it in the C language to test it and it actually worked great ! So I decided to take a long shot at publication of it, and contacted Dr. Dobb's and they contracted me to write up an article around the work. Yay !

The algorithm essentially computes the minima and maxima (i.e. peaks and valleys) *directly* for a set of discrete data points. Typical searches require the use of bracketed iterative searches and are hence much less efficient. My approach instead goes directly for a solution that computes a second derivative spline at the data "knots", and thus provides a fast and  accurate set of results. And handles both "happy path" and "unhappy path" test cases, as exhibited by the test data sets used in the development of the algorithm. Those data sets were presened in the original article, and are provided here for running the included unit tests.  

The algorithm was originally written in the C language, but here I am porting it to other languages as well. The reason it's in C is that it was the language of choice back then and that's what I knew well. For time calibration for the "younger" readers here, in 1994 the biggest movie was The Lion King, and the Sony Playstation came out. And in 1996 the big hit was Independence Day, and Nintendo 64 was launched !

So the languages that I know at varying levels since that publication and will be making the algorithm available in are Java, Python, C#, and C++. Therefore the 'ports' will involve redesign into object-oriented versions.
