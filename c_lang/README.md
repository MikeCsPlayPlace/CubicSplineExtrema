# CubicSplineExtrema

This is the directory that contains the original software that was published in Dr. Dobb's Journal #246 April 1996. It was written in the C language and that code is presented here as-is.

The easiest way to run this is probably via command line via gcc. Then you can just run the following in this directory:
 gcc cubic_extrema.c main.c -o main
and that will output a main executable that you can run via:
 ./main <absolute path to a test_data file>
